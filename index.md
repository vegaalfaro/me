## About Andrey

I am a plant breeder and geneticist passionate about building food systems through science and innovation. My work spans crops like beet, carrot, onion, tomato, pepper, and coffee, with a focus on integrating molecular tools, phenotypic data, and farmer-centered practical approaches. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I lead R&D efforts for root vegetable breeding and genetics.

I am also super interested in agribusiness, entrepreneurship and poetry. I am originally from Costa Rica and my favority music genera is reggaeton but I also like classical performance specially [Beethoven's 9th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOjHhS5MtvA) by my beloved [Chicago Symphony Orchestra](https://cso.org/) and [Maestro Mutti](https://www.riccardomuti.com/en/)
