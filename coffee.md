## Favorite Coffee Paper 2

**Genome assembly and chromosomal aberration**  
Nature communications, 2024  
[Read here]([https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14789](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44449-8))

This paper explores the complex history of coffee and how the variation is given by changes in chromosomal aberrations of two founder ancestral species namely C. eugenoides and C. canephora.
